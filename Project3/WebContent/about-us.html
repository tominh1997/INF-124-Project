			<p class="sectionDescription"> 
				Over more than a century, our iconic brand, Chocoholics, have been built on a foundation of community investment and connections between people around the world. Equally competitive and compassionate, we continue to build a legacy as we invest in the people and snacks of the future. From the beginning, our company believed that if you do good, you’ll do well. By doing what we do best—from our delicious snacks to spreading goodness in our communities—we bring people together. And while much has changed in America, the power of building connections with those around us—from consumers and shareholders, to our partners and employees—remains vital to the future of our communities and our business.

			<p class="sectionDescription">
			 We believe in offering the finest quality of chocolate combined with the highest quality treats. We couple that winning combination with honest, personalized, caring service and top it off with a gorgeous presentation that will be remembered gorgeous and uniquely yours.
			</p>
			<p class="sectionDescription">
			 Our servings are the most generous and numerous as we want you to indulge-indulge-indulge to your heart’s content.  Moreover, unlike other companies, one serving to us does not mean one piece of a cut-up, small supermarket strawberry, it means one of our huge, hand-picked long-stemmed strawberries (organically grown and picked fresh from the strawberry patch).  One serving from us is more like three servings from any other company.  We complete our dedication to providing the highest quality with our special recipe of gourmet, Chocoholics Signature  Chocolates.  Our chocolate simply tastes the best and is the creamiest!
