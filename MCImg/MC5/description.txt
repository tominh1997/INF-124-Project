Double Decker is a British brand of chocolate bar currently manufactured by Cadbury. First introduced in the UK in 1976, its name derives from the well-known double-decker bus, and the buses have sometimes appeared in advertisements for the product. It is a mixture of milk chocolate, nougat, and crisp, crunchy cereal. This has proved to be a very popular recipe, being used in cakes and other confections.
